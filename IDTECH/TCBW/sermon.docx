THE LOCAL CHURCH Track 3 By: Pastor Bayo.
Heb 2:1-9

The wisodm in the word of God is presented ina multi dimensional way. Though we are not using Matt 16 but we still see it saying the same thing that the wisodm of God is seen in the death, burial and resurection of Christ.

vs 9 - 15

He tasted death for everyman and secondly he defeated death. We cna day the death, burial and resurection of Christ is how he built His church. It means what we call church is a spiritual reality. ALso we can say the church is built on Christ. The Church is not built on a man or pastor but Christ.

What Does It mean that the Church is Built on CHrist?
He die, was burried and ressurected. If Jesus do not pass through this then their is no evidence of the church. This is why we first identify Jesus as the Christ.

Matt 16:
My Chruch - The meaning
The church has an identitty in Christ. Also it means Christ is the head of the Church.

The word Church is from the greek word Ekklesia. It means a define assembly. This word is gotten from two greek word.
Ek and Kaleo
Ek means out of.
Kaleo - means to call or to invite.
The two word will mean to call out of. It means Exodus. To come out of Egypt (suffering). It means a called out people. SO Jeus say I will call people out of bondage, oppression, suffering. I will call and invite people out of.
Church therefore will mean a defined assemply of people that has responded to the call of God out of suffering, Bondage, oppression of the devil.

How Does God Call People out of the Bondage, suffering and oppression of the Devil?

Rom 10:13-17
There is a hearing.
In vs 15 he told us what those men were saying. Then in vs 17 He told us by how. The word of God is the Gospel, the death burial and ressurection. The preaching of the Gospel is how God call men into the faith of Christ, into salvation. It means a man becomes saved when he/she heed the call of the Gospel. By believing, by responding to the call of the gospel.

Dont forget what Jesus has said will happen to His Church.
Also for the fact that Jesus said I will build my Church does not mean a man do not need a part to play. Doing this will mean universality which is wrong

John 2:19 - 21

Jesus said His body is the temple, i.e through it or in it men will be called together. That is He will die and this temple will be raised up and men can come into it. When we preach the gospel, we call men into this temple. Jesus is the temple of God.

John 14:31

According to Jesus by His death and ressurection He create many room. Room for all men and a man come into this room by believing the gospel.

So how a man becomes a member of His body - the church is not by doing good things but by believing the gospel. The death, burial and ressurection of CHrist.

When you say Jesus is Lord means Christ is my Head and I am a member of His body.

1 Pet 2:9
We been chosen here means that because Christ is the CHosen, the annointed one and now we are in Him, a member of His body then this is true of us too.

We need to acknowledge this truth from time to time. The apsotle always emphasis this anytime that they talk about the believer. We dont bend the truth also but we emphasis it too.

vs 10
How many time is the now, it is still now. Those who have believed has the identity of Christ.
Ephesians 1:18, 2 Tim 1:9, 2 Cor 6:15
We have been chosen. It means the church of God is chosen, peculiar and special and I am a member of it.

2 Cor 6:14-18
We are said to be separate and different from the word.
Are there ways to categorise people in the word?
Apart from country, continent, race, gneder, state of origin, etc. No one can convince us of this identity. The same way we are to be convinced about our identity in Christ.

The word understand the act of continous repetition in how to school the mind. The same way we are to continously emphasis on our reality in Christ. The same way the society take a long years, decades to make a man useful for the society, the same way too, we need to keep learning Christ for long years.
The same way then dont give you money in School when you want to collect a degree, you dont expect to be given money by coming to Church too.

So there is need for constant repetition of who we are and what we have become in CHrist. So faith in the gospel is how we become a member of Christ.

Who Can Become A Memebr of The CHurch of Christ? 
Anyone.
Act 2:47
ANyone who believed the gospel. 
Act 2:22-
The same audience that Peter was speaking to, were the same set of people that contributed to the death of Jesus. This same people are those that believe and were added to the Church.
Note: Peter do not say they should come and beg Jesus. Also though by wicked hand they have killed Jesus and they were sorry for it but yeat all they were to do is to believe.

So anyone and everyone can become the memeber of the HCurch of God
It is sinners that become member of the body of Christ.
1 Cor 6:9-11
By what we have said so far is how a person becomes a member of the body of Chirst And a man become by responding to the call by believing in the Gospel.

WHo is the Head of the Church?
Christ.
It means everyone that has believed is a member of the body of CHrist. This body is what we refers to as the universal Church.

Ehp 5:22, 1 Pet 5:1-4
Christ is the head and the sheep shepherd of the CHurch. He is the cornerstone. He is the one that everyone responds to. So whetehr in this Church or another you are a member of the body of Christ. You are a child of God.

Though when a man believe, He become saved and become a member of the Church. Is that all or What is next?
Jesus do not jumb believing in the ressurection even for the diciples. So where we all meet is believing in the ressurection of Christ.

Mark 16:14-
This means that the diciples also believe too. We can then say that the church of Christ starts witht the disciples, the 120 disciples.

JESUS IN THE LOCAL CHURCH
John 21:
Jesus is the head. He is the main shepherd of the sheep. But He will not remain with them. When he died, just as if the closing bell was rung, everyone go back to his stuffs.
vs 21:15-17
So although Jesus is called the head of the Church and the great shpherd but here we see Him delegating the responsibility of the taking care of the CHurch to Peter. This here is Jesus instituting the local CHurch. The Local church will refer to a particular gathering of the believer. Here the local Church is the gathering of the 120. It was not jsut normal to go to church but it is what Jesus institute that when I believe, I must be part of a specific gathering.

SO what follows salvation is that a man is enrolled, inducted into the local church. Everything follows from there. It means coming to church or joining  a partiular gathering is following what Jesus commnaded. When a man believe he/she is to join a local church - a specific gathering.

Act 2:41
Here we see what follows those that believe. The word added unto them means those that believe were added to a specific gathering that is the gathering of this 120.
So Jesus saying I will build my Church does not jsut mean a spiritual event but an institutin of the gatheering of beilievers.
Being added to the church is not Peter just saying everyone should not scatter but what Christ command.
Eph 4:7- , 1 Cor 12:28

So the local Church is part of the plan all along.

This means going to Church is compulsory. And if the death, burial and ressurection is the wisdom of God then being part of the Church is also a wisdom of God.

Though God do not promised to speak audibly to you every day but in the CHurch it is certain you will hear Him and be well fed, taught and spoken to.

Note: The word is not to condem us but to put us in the know.
